1.1:

It takes > 2 threads and some number >1000 iterations, such as 1500, to consistently (>90%) cause a failure.

1. It takes this many iterations because it increases the likelyhood of collision, the threads are active longer
and are more likely to context switch in the middle of the add operation.

2. Again, with a smaller number of operations, the thread is far less likely to collide with others, and is less
likely to context switch within the critical section of the operation. The operation is also likely to be correct even
if a context switch during the critical section occurs, as the values of the counter are so small, that they have a
higher chance of landing on zero. 

1.2:

After adding yield it only takes >20 options and >2 threads in order to cause a mismatch.

1. The reason the cost decreases is because
